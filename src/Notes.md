- useState always accepts two values:
    the state variable that's based upon the initial value we pass into it - in this case, undefined
        - a function defined setSessionToken.  setSessionToken is our means of changing the value of out state variable

        -naming convention for state variable is always what our state variable is called, and then 'set' ____

Naming convention for components is to start with a Capital letter

Props?
